/*
This is launcher program for application packaging on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Basic approach:
  - Launcher executable loads packager.dll/libpackager.dylib/libpackager.so and calls start_launcher below.
  - Reads app/package.cfg or Info.plist or app/<appname>.cfg for application launch configuration
     (package.cfg is property file).
  - Load JVM with requested JVM settings (bundled client JVM if availble, server or installed JVM otherwise).
  - Wait for JVM to exit and then exit from Main
  - To debug application by set env variable (TODO) or pass "/Debug" option on command line.
  - TODO: default directory is set to user's Documents and Settings.
  - Application folder is added to the library path (so LoadLibrary()) works.

Limitations and future work:
  - Running Java code in primordial thread may cause problems
    (example: can not use custom stack size).
    Solution used by java launcher is to create a new thread to invoke JVM.
    See CR 6316197 for more information.
